Compile
  This will generate a binary file called "main":
    `rustc main.rs`

Execution
  To execute a simple Rust binary file run:
    `./main`

Cargo
  Cargo can create projects with a simple template:
    `cargo new project`
  Cargo can build the projects:
    `cargo build`
    When the build is finished, you should be able to see the binary under the
    "target/ directory and also a bunch of other files and directories.
    When you run build all your dependencies in .toml file are fetched
  Cargo can run the project:
    `cargo run`
    There are a lot of options like --verbose, --quiet, --color
  Cargo can update your dependencies:
    `cargo update`
  Cargo can show documentation of a project!
    `cargo doc --open`
    This is very nice, you can also see the documentation of your dependencies!
    You can see documentation of your builded dependencies
    `cargo doc -p gcc --open`

  Rust language
    Pattern Matching
      match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
        Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
        Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
        Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
      }

      Each case inside the match is called "arm", an arm is like a switch case statement.

    Statically typed (must know all variables types at compile time).
    Variables and Constants cannot change it's type unless you use a parse function or something like this.
    Variables can change its value if it matches the type and if it is declared with the "mut" keyword.
    Constants cannot change value.

    Types
      Scalar
        Integer: can have i (signed: means it can be negative) and u (unsigned: means it will always be positive)
        Floating point: f32 (32 bits) and f64 (64 bits)
        Boolean: true or false
        Char: Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all valid char values in Rust.
      Compound
        Tuples: `let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);`
        Arrays: `let array: [i32;7] = [0,1,2,3,4,5,-1];`
                `let mut array: [i32;6] = [0,1,2,3,4,5];`
                `let array = [0,1,2,3,4,5];`
      Built-in
        bool:      Booleans
        char:      Characters
        i & u:     Intergers
        f32 & f64: Float
        []:        Array
        ():        Tupple

    Ownership
      It's a unique feature, it's how Rust programs manage their memory usage.
      The Stack and the Heap
        In most of programming languages you don't think about Stack and Heap.
        The Stack uses LIFO: last-in-first-out.
          You add data pushing-onto-the-stack, and remove data popping-off-the-stack.
          The Stack is simple and fast because there is always only one place to manipulate: the top.
          All the data in the stack has a known and fixed size.
        The Heap is like a bag.
          Data with unknown size at compile time can be stored on the heap.
          The Heap has less rules than the Stack, you request an amount of space and store in it, there is no "order" the store or access the data.
          When you allocate some space on the Heap, the OS finds a spot, marks it as being used and returns its address/pointer to this spot.
          The Heap is like a big restaurant, you come in and request a table, the staff (OS) finds one and lead you there, if someone is coming they can ask for your table address and go there.

        Heap is slower than the Stack, you have to process the address (follow the pointer) to access data.
          Contemporary processors are faster if they jump around less in memory. Continuing the analogy, consider a server at a restaurant taking orders from many tables. It’s most efficient to get all the orders at one table before moving on to the next table. Taking an order from table A, then an order from table B, then one from A again, and then one from B again would be a much slower process. By the same token, a processor can do its job better if it works on data that’s close to other data (as it is on the stack) rather than farther away (as it can be on the heap). Allocating a large amount of space on the heap can also take time.

        Heap gives you other types of power that the Stack does not.

      Rules:
        1. Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its owner.
        2. There can only be one owner at a time.
        3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

      Variables Scope
        { // s is out of scope, it does not exists yet
          let s = "string"; // s is declared from now on it is valid
          // do stuff with s there is valid
        } // s is going out of scope, it's no longer valid

      Literals x Types
        Literals like `let s = "string";`, their value cannot be mutated, you cannot append more text to s value.
        Literals like s are very efficient, because they are hardcoded after compile and it make them fast.
        Types like String `let mut s = String::from("hello");` enables the use of String methods and functions do mutate the s value.
        Types like these are stored in the Heap, to be managed/extended in runtime.

      Move x Shallow Copy x Deep Copy

      Copy Types
        Here are some of the types that are Copy:
          All the integer types, such as u32.
          The Boolean type, bool, with values true and false.
          All the floating point types, such as f64.
          The character type, char.
          Tuples, if they only contain types that are also Copy. For example, (i32, i32) is Copy, but (i32, String) is not.

      Ownership and Functions
        The mechanics of copy and moving values in functions are similar to variables assignment.

      Borrowing and References
        To borrow is the idea to give a new reference of a variable in the current scope to another scope.
          1. `let s = String::from("borrowed");`
          2. `borrow_s(&s);`
          In the second line we are using the token & to indicate that the value to be passed to the function is a reference/pointer to s (which is also a pointer to a value ("borrowed") in the Heap).
          Thus, the borrow_s function will be able to get s value and some behaviours.
          However, borrow_s function won't be able to mutate s, to do this we need to make s mutable and pass a "mut&" reference
            1. `let mut s = String::from("borrowed");`
            2. `borrow_s(&mut s);`
          Now, borrow_s function can mutate s using the "&mut s" pointer.

    Modules and Namespaces
      You can use Rust modules in Rust code.
      The concept of modules in Rust is similar to Python modules, a module is a bunch of functions, structs and resources you can access.
      The modules has hierarchy to access them.
      If a file A.rs and B.rs are under the same directory, they can see each other a use the public (pub) resources of the other.
        |-- A.rs
        |-- B.rs

        A:
          mod B
          fn function() {
              B.public_function_of_b();
          }

      If A.rs and B.rs are under different directories, the higher directory can
      see the other, if the lower directory expose the target module as public (pub)
      in a file called "mod.rs".

      |-- A.rs
      |-- module
      |   |---- B.rs
      |   |---- mod.rs

        mod.rs:
          pub mod B;

        A:
          use module::B;
          fn function() {
            B.public_function_of_b();
          }

    Structs
      Structs are User data types (or Custom data types). It's a grouping of data that make sense to be together.
      A User is an example of Struct, and it can have all types of data related to a real User, like username, password, address and so on.
      struct User {
          username: String,
          email: String,
          sign_in_count: u64,
          active: bool,
      }

      To create an instance of the struct User we can do:
      let user1 = User {
          email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
          username: String::from("someusername123"),
          active: true,
          sign_in_count: 1,
      };

      Methods
        You can add behaviour to data of Structs by using the Method notation.

        impl Struct {
            fn login(&self) {
                println!("Login with User's username: {}", self.username);
            }
        }

    Concurrency
      Threads
        The OS run multiple processes at once, and it permits to create OS threads! Inside your program you can do almost the same, you can use Threads (process like concept)
        to leverage the concurrency and parallel programming.
        By using Threads and also splitting your computing problem between a bunch of them you can increase performance.
          There are three main problems when using this technique:
            -> RACE CONDITIONS: your threads are accessing some memory in an inconsistent order.
            -> DEADLOCKS: your threads enter some state that depends on other threads state and they are also waiting on you.
              A is waiting for B and B is waiting for A.
            -> BUGS ARE HARD TO REPRODUCE: with RACE CONDITIONS and DEADLOCKS you usually have specific non trivial scenarios happening in production.
              To reproduce these scenarios in a controlled environment is difficult.

      RWlock vs Mutex
        RWLock is used so synchronize write over a shared memory state between threads.
        With RWLock, every write thread will acquire the lock and the memory will be safely altered.
        However, RWLock let whatever Read threads to acquire the lock, as long as there is no Write thread with the lock.
        So, with this type of lock, Read threads are "free" to read at any time, and the Write is blocking for any Read/Write thread.

        Mutex blocks Writes AND Reads as well, so, whatever thread tries to access the shared memory will be blocked if other thread has acquired the lock.

        Mutex = MUTual EXclusion
          To acquire data using Mutex, the thread needs to SIGNAL its intensions to access some data, when Mutex is ready to give the thread what it wants
          it sends the LOCK to the thread, which represents the key/microphone/token/permission/777 to do whatever the thread needs to do with that data/memory address.
          After the thread finish its work, it MUST unlock the data/memory by releasing (giving back to Mutex) the LOCK
      
      Send and Sync (they are Traits)
        Send is about transferring Ownership of something. Almost every type in Rust implements the Send trait.
        Sync is about synchronizing the access of threads to some value/memory.


    Error Handling
      panic! is like throwing and Exception.
      Result<T, E> is used as a template for function returns. With Result we pass two values, and T type (Ok path of the function)
      and E err, which represents the Error generated by the function execution. The Result<T,E> can be handled using the keyword "match".

      let f = File::open("hello.txt");
      let f = match f {
          Ok(file) => println!("Don't worry, everything is fine!"),
          Err(error) => {
              panic!("There was a problem opening the file: {:?}", error)
          },
      };

      To panic! or not to panic!?
        We just use panic! to show an error when and ONLY WHEN the code has 100% of certainty that the error is not recoverable.
        Otherwise, we use Result<T, E> to return the error to the client code and let it handle the error, because it might be recoverable.
        We panic! when there is a chance of the system entering a bad state, like database corruption or something like this.

    Macros

    Derive
      With the #[derive()] attribute you can tell the compiler to provide some basic implementations of Traits to specifics Structs in your code.
      Ex: 
        #[derive(Debug)]
        struct KV {
            value: String,
        }
        Now KV will be able to be printed in println! using the {:?} formatter.

        #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
        struct KV {
            value: String,
        }
      
      Now, KV can be Serialized and Deserialized into JSON format provided by the package serde_derive (you need to provide the package import of these Traits).

    Pointers
      Pointer is a reference to a value stored in the memory. Indicated by the
      & character. They don't have any special property other than reference to data.

      Smart Pointer is a reference to a value stored in the memory but it also has 
      metadata. SP are usually implemented using Structs, and it implements the
      Deref and Drop traits. There are several types of SP and libs usually have their
      own Smart Pointers.

      Examples of Smart Pointers:
        * Box<T>: allocates memory on the Heap
        * Rc<T>: enables multiple ownership

        Box<T> allocates value on the Heap, and the pointer to the value stays on the Stack.
        ```
          let b = Box::new(5); // allocates value "5" on the Heap and b as a reference on the Stack
          println!("b = {}", b);
        ```
      
      Deref
        This Trait acts making a reference to a pointer (another reference) work like a normal reference.
        ```
          fn main() {
            let x = 5;
            let y = &x;

            assert_eq!(5, x);
            assert_eq!(5, *y);
          }
        ```

        We declare a reference (x) to a i32 value (5), on the line 3 
        we declare another reference (y) that points to the x (which is a reference to 5);

        So y is basically a pointer to a pointer. We can follow the "rabbit hole" and get
        the real value, which is 5, if we use "*" to DEREF y, so "*y" gives us the 5 value
        which is stored on the memory (Stack).

      Move
        A reference to a value (variables and constants), they are initially owned by the
        function/scope where they were first declared.

        ```
          fn func() {
            let a = String::from("a");
          }
        ```

        Here, we see a variable called "a" being declared inside the scope of funct, this
        means that func OWNS a, when func ends, the value of a will also be gone, because Rust
        will call the drop Trait of a.

        ```
          fn func() {
            let a = String::from("a");
            another_func(a); // a is moved to another_func
          }
          
          fn another_func(String a) {
            println!("a: {}, was moved to me, I own it", a);
          }
        ```

        In this example, "a" is moved into another_func before func ends, "move" means that
        "a" is not owned by func anymore, and it will be gone when another_func ends, the ownership
        was "moved", transferred to another scope (another_func's scope);
