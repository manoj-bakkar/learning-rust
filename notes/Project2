Second Rust Project

Technologies
  Rust
  Git

Domain
  CLI tool to store ideas/notes (you can use Markdown) in a Git repo.
  You need to setup a Git repo (Bitbucket or GitHub) and setup in the config file.
    Nice to have:
      Pass all the parameters as flags of the command.
      Select between config files as a flag in the command.
  Just like eureka: https://github.com/simeg/eureka
